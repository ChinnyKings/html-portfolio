 <h3>The Six Tripple Eight</h3>
 <p>This is a very captivating millitary movie. <br />
It showed how in the times past, the military black women were mistreated and denied of basic necessities to carry out their operation. <br />
But in the end they conquered even without any support from the white superiors. </p>

<h3>Seven Doors</h3>
<p>This is an epic movie that portrayed the powers of the ancestors and the consequences of abusing one's power to do what one desires, disregarding the cry of the people under you.</p>
<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>A Christmas movie of a family that went on Christmas vacation, leaving their under 10 year-old child at home all by himself. </p>
